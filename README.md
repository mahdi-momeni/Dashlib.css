**Dashlib**  was born when we realized that we were spending a lot of time writing CSS in the CSS file, which was getting bigger and bigger with the CSS file. This led us to the idea of building a library called **Dashlib**

Dashlib is a great utility library that helps you take ready-made and responsive classes.

**Dashlib** helps you get less CSS code and more HTML file readability and extremely fast development speed. **Dashlib** also has the most standard Breakpoint sizes and support for older browsers.
**Dashlib** was developed based on the first mobile technique.

> Stylish, modern, compact and powerful front-end library for faster and easier web development.
